								<h2>Pricing</h2>
								<p>Pricing is the process whereby a business sets the price at which it will sell its products and services, and may be part of the business's marketing plan. In setting prices, the business will take into account the price at which it could acquire the goods, the manufacturing cost, the marketplace, competition, market condition, brand, and quality of product. <br>Pricing is a fundamental aspect of product management and is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix, the other three aspects being product, promotion, and place. Price is the only revenue generating element amongst the four Ps, the rest being cost centers. However, the other Ps of marketing will contribute to decreasing price elasticity and so enable price increases to drive greater revenue and profits. <br>Pricing can be a manual or automatic process of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry, shipment or invoice date, combination of multiple orders or lines, and many others. An automated pricing system requires more setup and maintenance but may prevent pricing errors. The needs of the consumer can be converted into demand only if the consumer has the willingness and capacity to buy the product. Thus, pricing is the most important concept in the field of marketing, it is used as a tactical decision in response to changing competitive, market and organizational situations. <br>
								Objectives of pricing <br>
								The objectives of pricing should consider: <br>
								the financial goals of the company <br>
								the fit with marketplace realities <br>
								the consistency of prices across categories and products <br>
							    the extent to which the price supports a product's market positioning and be consistent with the other variables in the marketing mix</p>

								<h2>Location</h2>
								<p>In geography, location or place are used to denote a region on Earth's surface or elsewhere. The term location generally implies a higher degree of certainty than place, the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of place identity and sense of place than on geometry. <br>Types <br>
								Locality <br>
								A locality, settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary that is not well defined varies by context. London, for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage. An area within a town, such as Covent Garden in London, also almost always has some ambiguity as to its extent. In geography, location is considered to be more precise than "place". <br>
								Relative location <br>A relative location, or situation, is described as a displacement from another site. An example is "3 miles northwest of Seattle". <br>
								Absolute location <br>An absolute location can be designated using a specific pairing of latitude and longitude in a Cartesian coordinate grid or similar methods. For example, the position of New York City in the United States can be expressed using the coordinate system as the location 40.7128°N, 74.0060°W. Absolute locations are also relative locations since even absolute locations are expressed relative to something else. For example, longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian, a line arbitrarily chosen to pass through Greenwich, England. Similarly, latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the equator. Because latitude and longitude</p>
